🌟 Project Concept

“Minecraft Revolution” is not just a website — it’s a scroll-driven narrative experience.

The site is structured as:

🎬 1 Intro Section

📊 8 Data Visualization Slides

🌅 1 Cinematic Outro

Each section uses animated graphs, micro-interactions, and immersive Minecraft-core aesthetics to tell the story of how one block reshaped digital history.

🚀 Why This Project Stands Out

✅ Data storytelling instead of static charts
✅ High-level animation integrated with analytics
✅ Strong visual identity
✅ Balanced aesthetics + performance
✅ Educational + commercial + cultural lens

This isn’t just visualization — it’s an interactive documentary.
